# Music Player

iPod style Music Player.  
Simple App, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  

#### Installation 

To make this music player work, you need to add for each song its respective image and audio file, with same name, for example: artist-title.jpg, artist-title.mp3.
For rights reason, this project does not display songs.
